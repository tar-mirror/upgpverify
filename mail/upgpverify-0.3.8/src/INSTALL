How to install upgpverify
       This document describes how to download, compile, test and
       install upgpverify.


   System requirements:
       The upgpverify package is meant	to  run	 under	UNIX  and
       -lookalikes.



   Create a /package directory:
	 $ mkdir /package
	 $ chmod 1755 /package
	 $ cd /package
       You   may   use	another	 directory.  No	 program  in  the
       upgpverify package cares where it is  installed.	 /package
       is recommended.

       The latest published upgpverify package is:

       http://www.ohse.de/uwe/upgpverify/upgpverify-0.3.8.tar.gz

       You can alternatively download it through FTP:

       ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/upgpverify/upgpverify-0.3.8.tar.gz



   Unpack the package:
	 $ gunzip upgpverify-0.3.8.tar.gz
	 $ tar -xpf upgpverify-0.3.8.tar
	 $ rm upgpverify-0.3.8.tar
	 $ cd mail/upgpverify-0.3.8


   Compile and install the programs:
	 $ package/install


   Where commands and documentation are installed:
       By    default	the    binaries	   are	  installed    in
       /package/upgpverify-0.3.8/commmand.  (replace /package/ by
       the  directory  where  you  you	unpacked  the  upgpverify
       distribution in).  Symbolic  links  to  the  commands  are
       created	in  /command/  and, for compatibility reasons, in
       /usr/local/bin.
       Manual	     pages	  are	     installed	       in
       /package/upgpverify-0.3.8/doc.	Symbolic   links  to  the
       manual pages are created under /usr/local/man.

       If you don't like this then:
	 $ package/compile && package/check
	 $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
	 $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc



   Self check:
       compile/install	(or  compile/check)  tries  to	run  some
       automated  tests if gpg, pgp2 and / or pgp5 are available.
       If these tests fail the software will not be  install.  If
       some  or all of the needed programs are not found in $PATH
       then upgpverify will be installed.

       The pgp binary is expected to run pgp version 2,	 and  the
       pgp5 command is expected to run pgp version 5.


   How to report success: (not mandatory)
	 $ mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de <compile/systype

       Please  do  not	send this email if the self-check failed.
       Send an problem report to the mailing list instead.



   Cleaning up:
       If you are short on disk space you may remove the  compile
       and src directories:
	 $ rm -rf compile src

       upgpverify-subscribe@lists.ohse.de.   The    content    is
       ignored.

       You do not need to subscribe to the mailing list, it is an
       open one.  But, if you are not subscribe,  make	sure  you

       Please	include	  the	upgpverify  version  number,  the
       operating  system  and  it's  version  and  any	 possible
       relevant	 output	 of  the failing program.  Please include
