The upgpverify package is meant to run under UNIX and -lookalikes.
.paragraph
.LINE
.subsection "Create a /package directory:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ mkdir /package
  $ chmod 1755 /package
  $ cd /package
.HTML </pre>

.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/install
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.subsection "Where commands and documentation are installed:"
By default the binaries are installed in \fB/package/\*(PA-\*(VE/commmand\fR.
(replace /package/ by the directory where you you unpacked the upgpverify 
distribution in). Symbolic links to the commands are created in 
\fB/command/\fR and, for compatibility reasons, in \fB/usr/local/bin\fR.

links to the manual pages are created under \fB/usr/local/man\fR.

If you don't like this then:
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/compile && package/check
  $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
  $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
.subsection "Self check:"
\fBcompile/install\fR (or \fBcompile/check\fR) tries to run some automated 
tests if gpg, pgp2 and / or pgp5 are available. If these
tests fail the software will not be install. If some or all of the
needed programs are not found in $PATH then \*(PA will be installed.
.paragraph
The \fIpgp\fR binary is expected to run pgp version 2, and the 
\fIpgp5\fR command is expected to run pgp version 5.
