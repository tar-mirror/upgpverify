This package is published under the GNU General Public License, Version 2.

Some files in this package are published under a different license. See
below for a list. A files license has a higher precedence than the
package license. Any conflict arising from the different licenses are
to be resolved on that base.


GPL:           The GNU General Public License. In short:
    * Redistribution allowed
    * Modifications allowed, subject to Rule #2 in the GPL
      (prominent notes in the changed files).
	* Distribution of binaries allowed, as long as the source is
	  made available.

public domain: 
	* No copyright claimed by anybody. Use as you please.

Copyright djb: The copyright used by Daniel J. Bernstein - djb@pobox.com.
	* Redistribution of unmodified files allowed.
	* Distribution of patches allowed.
	If you really need to modify one of those files: Ask djb or 
	distribute a patch - you might want to alter the Makefile to
	generate file "file.c":
		file.c: file.c.djb file.c.patch
			patch <file.c.patch
	Note the renaming isn't a modification of the file, but a
	modification of the package.
